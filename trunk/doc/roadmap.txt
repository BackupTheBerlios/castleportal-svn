Roadmap:


1. Add an image upload plugin for tinyMce.

     - Another way and maybe a better one, is to integrate advimage: 
          http://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=103281&atid=738747&file_id=195980&aid=1568343
     - This is another approach:

2. Use Lazy collections for relations


3. Migrate to ActiveRecord generics
